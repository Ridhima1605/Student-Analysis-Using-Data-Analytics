# Interactive Elements in Visualizations

This project incorporates interactive features to improve user engagement and data exploration. Below are the key interactive elements implemented:

## 1. Tooltips  
- Display detailed information on hover, including exact values and percentages.  
- Help users understand data points without cluttering the chart visually.

## 2. Hover Effects  
- Highlight bars, slices, or points when hovered to visually indicate focus.  
- Use color intensity changes to guide attention.

## 3. Zooming and Panning (Future Scope)  
- While not currently implemented, adding zoom and pan would allow users to explore data more closely.

## 4. Filtering (Future Scope)  
- Potential to add filters (e.g., by subject or attendance status) to customize the visible data dynamically.

## How Interactivity Enhances the User Experience

- Provides instant feedback when users explore the charts.  
- Makes complex data easier to digest by revealing on-demand details.  
- Encourages deeper analysis and discovery of insights.

## Technical Implementation Details

- Used **Chart.js** built-in tooltip functionality for all charts.  
- Configured tooltips to show formatted data labels clearly.  
- Hover styles are controlled via Chart.js dataset properties and CSS for smooth user experience.
