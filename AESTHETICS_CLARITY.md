# Aesthetics and Clarity of Visualizations

Effective data visualization depends heavily on aesthetics and clarity to convey insights clearly and attractively. Below are the guiding principles applied in this project:

## Principles Followed

### 1. Simplicity  
- Minimalistic design to focus on key data points without clutter.

### 2. Consistent Color Palette  
- Colors chosen to be harmonious and colorblind-friendly.  
- Same color scheme used consistently across charts for related categories.

### 3. Clear Labels and Legends  
- Every axis and chart element is clearly labeled for easy understanding.  
- Legends placed strategically to avoid confusion.

### 4. Readable Fonts and Sizes  
- Fonts chosen for readability (Segoe UI, Arial).  
- Font sizes balanced for titles, labels, and tooltips.

### 5. Proper Use of Space  
- Balanced white space ensures charts are not overcrowded.  
- Adequate margins and padding around chart elements.

### 6. Appropriate Axis Scaling  
- Axes start from zero or appropriate minimums to avoid misleading impressions.  
- Consistent scales used for comparison.

### 7. Highlights and Annotations  
- Important data points and trends highlighted with colors or tooltips.  
- Interactive tooltips enhance user engagement and interpretation.
